Readme

This is a drawing application (like a relatively basic version of MS Paint, for example) built using Java and Swing.


To draw a shape on the canvas, click a shape, and choose a line thickness,
and use the mouse to draw it on the canvas.
There is tiny box between the drawing tools and line thickness that shows
color selection dialog.
bug fix_later- You will have to select the color again after clicking with fill on a shape for the color to show, but it does workâ€¦
There is also an implementation of dockable toolbars.
